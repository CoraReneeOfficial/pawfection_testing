DEBUG LOGO UPLOAD
=================

1. Flask config UPLOAD_FOLDER:
   - Currently set to: <project_root>/uploads
   - Actual value: determined by PERSISTENT_DATA_ROOT (usually project root)

2. Edit store upload logic:
   - Saves logo to: current_app.config['UPLOAD_FOLDER']
   - This is NOT the same as static/uploads/store_logos

3. Template expects:
   - <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='uploads/store_logos/' ~ store.logo_filename) }}">
   - This expects logo to be in static/uploads/store_logos

4. Actual upload location:
   - Logo is being saved to: <project_root>/uploads
   - NOT accessible via static!

5. Directory static/uploads/store_logos is EMPTY.

6. Solution:
   - Change upload logic in edit_store to save to static/uploads/store_logos, NOT UPLOAD_FOLDER.
   - This will make logo accessible at the same path as the template expects.

7. Action required:
   - Update management/routes.py to:
     upload_folder = os.path.join(current_app.static_folder, 'uploads', 'store_logos')

8. After fix:
   - Re-upload logo from edit page.
   - Logo should appear in static/uploads/store_logos and display on public page.
